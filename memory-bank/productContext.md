## Product Context — NCA Website

### Why this exists
NCA needs a modern web presence for acquiring leads and publishing informational content, plus an internal back-office to manage incoming requests and content efficiently.

### Target users
- **Public visitors**: discover insurance offers, read articles, and submit requests.
- **Admins/Editors**: manage leads, blog posts, and site content safely and quickly.

### UX principles
- Professional, quiet UI: muted palette, dense but readable layouts, subtle transitions.
- Admin UX should feel like a high-end enterprise tool (fast list/detail flows, minimal friction).
- Blog authoring should support:
  - Basic formatting (headings, bold/italic, lists, quotes)
  - Links
  - Images
  - A small set of custom blocks/components (extensible)

### Success criteria
- Admins can log in and manage users/leads/blog without touching Supabase dashboard.
- Leads are stored reliably and are searchable/filterable in admin.
- Blog posts can be drafted, edited, and published with a clean editor and image upload.
